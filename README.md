javascript and api intro
Learned that inputs inside of forms reload the page when you hit enter. To get inputs to behave correctly, do not put inside a form.
Used Giphy api again because tmdb did not return enough results and couldn't figure out how to get an image url. Could get the final part of a poster path.
Need to figure out how to use arrays or maps for this code. Much too repetitive.
